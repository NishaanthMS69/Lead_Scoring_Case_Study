# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
## Problem Statement

  Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, an education firm. Many experts who are interested in the courses visit their website and look over the course offerings on any given day.  They offer a form-filling procedure on their website, following which the business takes the lead.
Following the acquisition of these leads, sales team members begin contacting customers by phone, email, etc.  While the majority of the leads do not convert during this procedure, some do.
At X Education, the average lead conversion rate is about 30%. This implies that only roughly 30 of the 100 leads they generate in a day will actually be converted. The organization wants to find the most potential leads, or Hot Leads in order to streamline this procedure.
Since the sales staff will now be concentrating more on interacting with the potential prospects rather than calling everyone, the lead conversion rate should increase if they are successful in identifying this group of leads.


## Objective

  Lead X requests that we develop a model that assigns a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each lead.  In order for them to find the hot leads and boost their conversion rate.
The CEO aims for an 80% lead conversion rate.
They want the model to be able to manage future limitations as well, such as the activities that must be taken during peak times, how to use all available manpower, and what to do once the goal has been reached.
